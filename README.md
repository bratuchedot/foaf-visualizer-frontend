## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn

## Step 1: Cloning the Repository

1. **Open Terminal:** Launch your terminal or command prompt.
2. **Choose Directory:** Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project. Use the `cd` command to move to the desired directory.
3. **Clone the Repository:** Run the following command to clone the repository from GitHub:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/bratuchedot/foaf-visualizer-frontend.git
    ```
4. **Navigate to Project Directory:** Move into the newly cloned project directory:

    ```

## Step 2: Project Configuration
